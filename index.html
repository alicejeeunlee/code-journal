            <h3>Pikachu</h3>
            <p>Pikachu is a short, chubby rodent Pokémon. It is covered in yellow fur with two horizontal brown stripes on its back.
              It has a small mouth, long, pointed ears with black tips, and brown eyes. Each cheek is a red circle that contains a pouch
              for electricity storage. It has short forearms with five fingers on each paw, and its feet each have three toes. At
              the base of its lightning bolt-shaped tail is a patch of brown fur. A female will have a V-shaped notch at the end of its
              tail, which looks like the top of a heart. It is classified as a quadruped, but it has been known to stand and walk on
              its hind legs.</p>

            <h3>Charmander</h3>
            <p>Charmander is a bipedal, reptilian Pokémon with a primarily orange body and blue eyes. Its underside from the chest down
            and the soles of its feet are cream-colored. It has two small fangs visible in its upper jaw and two smaller fangs in
            its lower jaw. A fire burns at the tip of this Pokémon's slender tail and has blazed there since Charmander's birth. The
            flame can be used as an indication of Charmander's health and mood, burning brightly when the Pokémon is strong, weakly
            when it is exhausted, wavering when it is happy, and blazing when it is enraged. It is said that Charmander dies if its
            flame goes out. However, if the Pokémon is healthy, the flame will continue to burn even if it gets a bit wet and is
            said to steam in the rain.</p>
